## JS FEATURES
1. **Dark/Light Mode**: This feature has been added on every page and it allows the users to switch from a dark mode to light mode. This was designed so the user can switch according to their preference.  
2. **Slider**: A slider has been added on the homepage that allows the user to view different images by clicking on next and the previous button. This creates interactivity with the users.
3. **Menu Toggler**: A menu toggler has been added on every page, so the user can easily access the navigation links when the page is made responsive.
4. **Back to Top button**: I also added a back to top button to make the website user-friendly. This saves time because the user does not have to scroll all the way to the top.
5. **API**: An External API has been used on the movies page. This allows the user to view the different movies and also search for movies. The description of the movie can also be viewed by hovering over the tile.
6. **Dialog Box**: A dialog box has been added on the contact us page. This appears when the user completes the form and clicks on the submit button.
7. **Review List**: An add function has been added on the reviews page. This allows the user to add new reviews. It also saves and loads the data from storage.
